abstract = {In this survey we discuss different state-of-the-art approaches of combining exact algorithms and metaheuristics to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Some of these hybrids mainly aim at providing optimal solutions in shorter time, while others primarily focus on getting better heuristic solutions. The two main categories in which we divide the approaches are collaborative versus integrative combinations.We further classify the different techniques in a hierarchical way. Altogether, the surveyed work on combinations of exact algorithms and metaheuristics documents the usefulness and strong potential of this research direction.},

@article{Gao2011,
abstract = {Cloud computing not only changes today's computing infrastructure, but also alters the way of obtaining computing resources, managing and delivering software and services. Meanwhile, cloud computing brings new issues, challenges, and needs in performance testing, evaluation and scalability measurement due to the special features of cloud computing, such as elasticity and scalability. This paper focuses on performance evaluation and scalability measurement issue for Software as a Service (SaaS) in clouds. It proposes new formal graphic models and metrics to evaluate SaaS performance and analyze system scalability in clouds. In addition, the paper reports an evaluation approach based on Amazon's EC2 cloud technology and detailed case study results using the proposed models and metrics.},

@article{Jamshidi2013,
abstract = {Abstract—Background—By leveraging cloud services, organizations can deploy their software systems over a pool of resources. However, organizations heavily depend on their business-critical systems, which have been developed over long periods. These legacy applications are usually deployed on-premise. In recent years, research in cloud migration has been carried out. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate this research. Objective—This paper aims to identify, taxonomically classify, and systematically compare existing research on cloud migration. Method—We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 23 selected studies, published from 2010 to 2013. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework that we also introduce in this paper. Results—The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of current solutions for legacy-to-cloud migration. This review also identifies research gaps and directions for future research. Conclusion—This review reveals that cloud migration research is still in early stages of maturity, but is advancing. It identifies the needs for a migration framework to help improving the maturity level and consequently trust into cloud migration. This review shows a lack of tool support to automate migration tasks. This study also identifies needs for architectural adaptation and self-adaptive cloud-enabled systems},

@article{Kitchenham2007,
abstract = {The objective of this report is to propose comprehensive guidelines for systematic literature reviews appropriate for software engineering researchers, including PhD students. A systematic literature review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guidelines presented in this report were derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers, two books produced by researchers with social science backgrounds and discussions with researchers from other disciplines who are involved in evidence-based practice. The guidelines have been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research. The guidelines cover three phases of a systematic literature review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. They provide a relatively high level description. They do not consider the impact of the research questions on the review procedures, nor do they specify in detail the mechanisms needed to perform meta-analysis.},

@article{Blum2012,
abstract = {Research in metaheuristics for combinatorial optimization problems has lately experienced a noteworthy shift towards the hybridization of metaheuristics with other techniques for optimization. At the same time, the focus of research has changed from being rather algorithm-oriented to being more problem-oriented. Nowadays the focus is on solving the problem at hand in the best way possible, rather than promoting a certain metaheuristic. This has led to an enormously fruitful cross-fertilization of different areas of optimization. This cross-fertilization is documented by a multitude of powerful hybrid algorithms that were obtained by combining components from several different optimization techniques. Hereby, hybridization is not restricted to the combination of different metaheuristics but includes, for example, the combination of exact algorithms and metaheuristics. In this work we provide a survey of some of the most important lines of hybridization. The literature review is accompanied by the presentation of illustrative examples. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Jiang2009,
	Abstract = {The goal of a load test is to uncover functional and per- formance problems of a system under load. Performance problems refer to the situations where a system suffers from unexpectedly high response time or low throughput. It is difficult to detect performance problems in a load test due to the absence of formally-defined performance objectives and the large amount of data that must be examined. In this paper, we present an approach which automati- cally analyzes the execution logs of a load test for perfor- mance problems. We first derive the system's performance baseline from previous runs. Then we perform an in-depth performance comparison against the derived performance baseline. Case studies show that our approach produces few false alarms (with a precision of 77\%) and scales well to large industrial systems.},

@article{Afzal2009a,
	Abstract = {Search-based software testing is the application of metaheuristic search techniques to generate software tests. The test adequacy criterion is transformed into a fitness function and a set of solutions in the search space are evaluated with respect to the fitness function using a metaheuristic search technique. The application of metaheuristic search techniques for testing is promising due to the fact that exhaustive testing is infeasible considering the size and complexity of software under test. Search-based software testing has been applied across the spectrum of test case design methods; this includes white-box (structural), black-box (functional) and grey-box (combination of structural and functional) testing. In addition, metaheuristic search techniques have also been applied to test non-functional properties. The overall objective of undertaking this systematic review is to examine existing work into non-functional search-based software testing (NFSBST). We are interested in types of non-functional testing targeted using metaheuristic search techniques, different fitness functions used in different types of search-based non-functional testing and challenges in the application of these techniques. The systematic review is based on a comprehensive set of 35 articles obtained after a multi-stage selection process and have been published in the time span 1996-2007. The results of the review show that metaheuristic search techniques have been applied for non-functional testing of execution time, quality of service, security, usability and safety. A variety of metaheuristic search techniques are found to be applicable for non-functional testing including simulated annealing, tabu search, genetic algorithms, ant colony methods, grammatical evolution, genetic programming (and its variants including linear genetic programming) and swarm intelligence methods. The review reports on different fitness functions used to guide the search for each of the categories of execution time, safety, usability, quality of service and security; along with a discussion of possible challenges in the application of metaheuristic search techniques. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {This practical book provides a step-by-step approach to testing mission-critical applications for scalability and performance before they're deployed -- a vital topic to which other books devote one chapter, if that. Businesses today live and die by network applications and web services. Because of the increasing complexity of these programs, and the pressure to deploy them quickly, many professionals don't take the time to ensure that they'll perform well and scale effectively. The Art of Application Performance Testing explains the complete life cycle of the testing process, and demonstrates best practices to help you plan, gain approval for, coordinate, and conduct performance tests on your applications. With this book, you'll learn to: Set realistic performance testing goals Implement an effective application performance testing strategy Interpret performance test results Cope with different application technologies and architectures Use automated performance testing tools Test traditional local applications, web-based applications, and web services (SOAs) Recognize and resolves issues that are often overlooked in performance tests Written by a consultant with 30 years of experience in the IT industry and over 12 years experience with performance testing, this easy-to-read book is illustrated with real-world examples and packed with practical advice. The Art of Application Performance Testing thoroughly explains the pitfalls of an inadequate testing strategy and offers you a robust, structured approach for ensuring that your applications perform well and scale effectively when the need arises. "Ian has maintained a vendor-agnostic methodology beautifully in this material. The metrics and graphs, along with background information provided in his case studies, eloquently convey to the reader, 'Methodology above all, tools at your discretion...'

	Abstract = {In this work we are studying possibilities to test software using genetic algorithm search. The idea is to produce test cases in order to find problematic situations like processing time extremes. The proposed test method comes under the heading of automated dynamic stress testing. Keywords: genetic algorithms, software engineering, dynamic stress testing 1 Introduction Real-time software is increasingly applied to products in which failure may have severe consequences, thus the requirements for correctness and reliability are getting higher, too. In very reliable sequential programs, the rate of errors should be less than 10 errors/1000 lines of code, to avoid functional failure. Achieving this level is very labourious, because the amount of program testing work grows exponentially with code size. Testing software manually is slow, expensive and demands inventiveness. Automated testing can reduce both the time and costs needed for performing tests. Exhaustive test data generation is...},

	Abstract = {This survey investigates search-based approaches to software design. The basics of the most popular meta-heuristic algorithms are presented as background to the search-based viewpoint. Software design is considered from a wide viewpoint, including topics that can also be categorized as software maintenance or re-engineering. Search-based approaches have been used in research from the high architecture design level to software clustering and finally software refactoring. Enhancing and predicting software quality with search-based methods is also taken into account as a part of the design process. The background for the underlying software engineering problems is discussed, after which search-based approaches are presented. Summarizing remarks and tables collecting the fundamental issues of approaches for each type of problem are given. The choices regarding critical decisions, such as representation and fitness function, when used in meta-heuristic search algorithms, are emphasized and discussed in detail. Ideas for future research directions are also given. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

In this paper we propose a lightweight framework for hosting Web services on mobile devices. We further evaluate and provide a comparative analysis for hosting RESTful Web services versus SOAP-based Web services on our framework. Our experimental results and analysis indicate that RESTful Web services are less resource-consuming and more efficient for the implementation and provisioning of Web services from resource-constrained mobile devices. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The goal of the work is to develop and evaluate tools for offline and online analysis of system metrics gathered from instrumentation in Internet server platforms. We use a promising class of probabilistic models (Tree-Augmented Bayesian Networks or TANs) to identify combinations of system-level metrics and threshold values that correlate with high-level with Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for average-case response timein a three-tier Web service under a variety of conditions. Experimental results from a testbed show that TAN models involving small subsets of metrics capture patterns of performance behavior in a way that is accurate and yields insights into the causes of observed performance effects. TANs are extremely efficient to represent and evaluate, and they have interpretability properties that make them excellent candidates for automated diagnosis and control. We explore the use of TAN models for offline forensic diagnosis, and in a limited online setting for performance forecasting with stable workloads.},

the US public switched telephone network (PSTN) shows that human
intervention is one key to this large system's reliability. Software is
not the weak link in the PSTN system's dependability. Extensive use of
built-in self-test and recovery mechanisms in major system components
(switches) contributed to software dependability and are significant
design features in the PSTN. The network's high dependability indicates
that the trade-off between dependability gains and complexity introduced
by built-in self-test and recovery mechanisms can be positive. Likewise,
the tradeoff between complex interactions and the loose coupling of
system components has been positive, permitting quick human intervention
in most system failures and resulting in an extremely reliable system

	Abstract = {This is the second half of a two part series devoted to the tabu search metastrategy for optimization problems. Part I introduced the fundamental ideas of tabu search as an approach for guiding other heuristics to overcome the limitations of local optimality, both in a deterministic and a probabilistic framework. Part I also reported successful applications from a wide range of settings, in which tabu search frequently made it possible to obtain higher quality solutions than previously obtained with competing strategies, generally with less computational effort. Part II, in this issue, examines refinements and more advanced aspects of tabu search. Following a brief review of notation, Part II introduces new dynamic strategies for managing tabu lists, allowing fuller exploitation of underlying evaluation functions. In turn, the elements of staged search and structured move sets are characterized, which bear on the issue of finiteness. Three ways of applying tabu search to the solution of integer programming problems are then described, providing connections also to certain nonlinear programming applications. Finally, the paper concludes with a brief survey of new applications of tabu search that have occurred since the developments reported in Part I. Together with additional comparisons with other methods on a wide body of problems, these include results of parallel processing implementations and the use of tabu search in settings ranging from telecommunications to neural networks.},

Even when they do converge, there is no assurance that they have found the global, rather than a local, optimum. We test a new optimization algorithm, simulated annealing, on four econometric problems and compare it to three common conventional algorithms. Not only can simulated annealing find the global optimum, it is also less likely to fail on difficult functions because it is a very robust algorithm. The promise of simulated annealing is demonstrated on the four econometric problems.},

@article{Mueller1998,
	Abstract = {The paper contrasts two methods to verify timing constraints of
real-time applications. The method of static analysis predicts the
worst-case and best-case execution times of a task's code by analyzing
execution paths and simulating processor characteristics without ever
executing the program or requiring the program's input. Evolutionary
testing is an iterative testing procedure, which approximates the
extreme execution times within several generations. By executing the
test object dynamically and measuring the execution times the inputs are
guided yielding gradually tighter predictions of the extreme execution
times. The authors examined both approaches on a number of real world
examples. The results show that static analysis and evolutionary testing
are complementary methods, which together provide upper and lower bounds
for both worst-case and best-case execution times},

prone to errors, because they often rely on information provided by the
user. The paper presents a method for testing the results of static WCET
analysis. The proposed test method is a blackbox test method that uses a
genetic algorithm (GA) for test case generation. Important properties of
the method are: (a) that it requires minimal information about possible
impact data from the user and (b) that the GA guides data generation
into directions that have a good chance to yield the real WCET of the
program under test. Experimental results show that GA based testing
produces results of high quality},
