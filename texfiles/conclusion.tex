\section{Conclusion}

This paper presented a approach of use combinatorial optimization algorithm in load, performance and stress testing. The study performed a systematic review ; the development of a plugin and two experiments. The IAdapter is a JMeter Plugin to perform evolutionary load, performance or stress tests. The IAdapter plugin makes it possible to create a generative model that evolves during the test. The first experiment has been applied in an emulated component and the second experiment has been applied in an installed Moodle application.  The collaborative approach has obtained better fit values in both experiments. 

The main contributions of the research are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The presentation of an approach that uses a hybrid metauristc approach;
\item The use of Tabu Search Algorithm ( TS ) to find scenarios that break the  service level defined by the application under test;
\end{itemize}

The secondary contributions of the research are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The provision of a JMeter plugin for conducting performance, load or stress  testing.
\item The automation of the  load, performance or stress test execution process.
\end{itemize}

Among the future work of the research, we can highlight the use of new combinatorial optimization algorithms such as Very large-scale neighborhood search.
