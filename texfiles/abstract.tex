%% Text of abstract
Many software must respond to  thousands or millions of concurrent requests. 
These systems must be properly tested to ensure that they can function correctly under the expected load.  
Load, Performance and Stress Evolutionary testing aims to find test scenarios which produce execution times violating the timing constraints specified. 
The purpose of this paper is propose the use of a approach using  hybrid metaheuristc  in load, performance and stress test models  using Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search Algorithms. A tool named IAdapter ,  a JMeter Plugin to perform evolutionary load, performance or stress tests, was developed. Two experiments were conducted to validate the proposed approach. The first experiment has been applied in an emulated component and the second experiment has been applied in an installed Moodle application.  In both experiments,  the use of a hybrid metaheurisct  has obtained better fitnesse values.
