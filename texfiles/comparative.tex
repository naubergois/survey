\section{Contributions and Comparative Analysis}

The main contributions of the research are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The presentation of an approach that uses a committee of algorithms (GA, SA and TS);
\item The use of Tabu Search Algorithm ( TS ) to find scenarios that break the  service level defined by the application under test;
\end{itemize}

The secondary contributions of the research are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The provision of a JMeter plugin for conducting performance, load or stress  testing.
\item The extension of the survey conducted by  Afzal et al. in the Load, Performance and Stress testing context \cite{Afzal2009}
\item The automation of the  load, performance or stress test execution process.
\end{itemize}

The Figure \ref{fig:comparison} presents the comparison between this research and the others studies found in the systematic review. The IAdapter presents a solution that uses a committee of algorithms in a measurement approach using a functional tool (JMeter with IAdapter plugin).
